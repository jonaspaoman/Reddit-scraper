Best_Gur3923,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share my recent nightmare of an experience at Manipal Hospital with how my kidney stone treatment was handled. I underwent the RT RIRS surgery to remove a 5.5 mm stone. I hope this helps others be more cautious and aware when dealing with medical advice. I’ll try to keep it as concise as possible, but it’s been a long and frustrating journey.

\---

\*\*The Timeline:\*\*

\*\*1. 14th Sep: Visit to the Emergency Room\*\*

I went to the ER with extreme pain due to a kidney stone. After the initial pain relief, they told me to consult a urologist. I met Dr. X, who advised a CT scan. When the scan came back, he vaguely said the stone was “very big,” without actually specifying the size. Later, when I saw the UT scan report, it said the stone was about 4.5 to 5.5 mm. I have a history of passing stones this size naturally, but I felt pressured into surgery(RT RIRS)  without any alternatives being explained to me. They knew I had insurance and asked me to get all pre approvals and get surgery done the next working day. 

\*\*2. 16th Sep: RT RIRS Surgery\*\*

I went ahead with the surgery. Dr. X told me I could go back to all my normal physical activities (gym, sports, etc.) right after. But here’s the kicker: when I saw the dietician afterward, she actually laughed at that advice and said I needed to be careful for the next few weeks! I was so confused and felt totally misinformed. For the next few days, I was extremely lethargic but started feeling better after 3-4 days.

\*\*3. 30th Sep: Sudden High Fever\*\*

I started running a fever of 102°F with no other symptoms. I contacted Dr. X's assistant, G, as I suspected it was due to the stent. G dismissed this and didn’t take it seriously. I even went to see Dr. X on 1st Oct, but he brushed off my concerns, saying the stent couldn’t be causing the fever. By this point, my fever was consistently 103-104°F, and I was miserable.

\*\*4. 1st-2nd Oct: Misdiagnosis and Delayed Tests\*\*

They referred me to Dr. Y, who was about to go on leave the next day (great timing, right?). She ordered a bunch of tests – CRP, CBC, Typhoid, Dengue – but didn’t even include a Kidney Function Test (KFT). By 2nd Oct, my CRP levels were sky-high at 190, and I was still in a horrible state. Meanwhile, G kept saying it was typhoid and that I needed to be admitted – which was completely wrong.

\*\*5. 2nd-4th Oct: Finally, the Stent Is Removed\*\*

I couldn’t take the pain and trauma anymore, so I went back to the emergency room on 2nd Oct. This time, the duty doctor immediately ordered a KFT, which showed high creatinine levels (a major red flag that should have been noticed days earlier!). Despite all this, they still kept thinking it was some viral infection, and it took until 4th Oct for them to finally remove the DJ stent, which immediately made me feel better.

\*\*6. In-Hospital Care: Horrendous\*\*

Throughout my hospital stay, the nurses were super unresponsive and lacked any kind of personal care. I had severe neck pain due to improper head posture, which I’d been complaining about since day one of my admission. Despite raising it with Dr. Z, no one took it seriously until I insisted on seeing a physiotherapist. To top it off, there was no duty doctor on the night of 4th Oct when I was in terrible pain. I had to wait until the morning to get any pain relief! 

  
After this ordeal , I had lost around 9% body weight, took me 2 weeks to recover and sick off from office. And many more months to completely recover and get back to my normal day to day physical activities like Gym, Tennis, running etc",submission,2024-10-24 08:39:08,True,kidney stone treatment,1gb5lzo,146,bangalore," Horrible Experience with Kidney Stone Treatment at Manipal Hospital Varthur – Misdiagnosis, Delayed Care, and Negligence**",https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/1gb5lzo/horrible_experience_with_kidney_stone_treatment/

I was wondering if there are any treatments that he could possibly get as he was also enrolled for a clinical trial but his blood tests weren’t a match for it?

Background: I am  deciding between shock wave lithotripsy versus participating in a research study that would be less invasive (no anesthesia). 

Without going into too much detail, standard of care would involve one low dose, no-contrast CT scan whereas the research study would involve at least two. I really want to go the less invasive route, but I'm nervous about added radiation exposure. Can you help me contextualize the actual risk associated with getting two CTs instead of one?

When it comes to advanced kidney stone treatment, Dr. Deepesh Kalra is a leading specialist, renowned for his expertise in Retrograde Intrarenal Surgery (RIRS). This minimally invasive procedure offers a highly effective solution for treating kidney stones, especially those that are difficult to manage with conventional methods.

# What is RIRS Surgery?

Retrograde Intrarenal Surgery (RIRS) is a sophisticated technique used to remove kidney stones through a minimally invasive approach. This procedure involves the use of a flexible endoscope called a ureteroscope, which is inserted through the urethra and bladder to access the kidneys. Unlike traditional surgeries, RIRS does not require large incisions, which means reduced recovery time and minimal discomfort for the patient.

# Why Choose RIRS for Kidney Stone Treatment?

RIRS is often recommended for patients who have kidney stones that are too large to pass on their own or when other treatments have been unsuccessful. This technique offers several advantages:

* **Minimally Invasive**: RIRS is performed through natural body orifices, which means there are no external incisions. This leads to a quicker recovery and less postoperative pain compared to traditional surgical methods.
* **Reduced Risk**: With RIRS, there is a lower risk of complications such as infection or damage to surrounding tissues.

# Dr. Deepesh Kalra’s Approach to RIRS Surgery

As an expert in[ **kidney stone treatment, Dr. Deepesh Kalra utilizes RIRS** ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YQ27xM9s6vpJK18N7)to provide optimal outcomes for his patients. Here’s how Dr. Kalra approaches RIRS surgery:

1. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Dr. Kalra begins with a detailed assessment, including medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic imaging (such as CT scans or ultrasounds) to determine the size, location, and composition of the kidney stones.
2. **Preoperative Planning**: Based on the evaluation, Dr. Kalra formulates a personalized treatment plan. This includes preparing the patient for RIRS surgery by discussing the procedure, expected outcomes, and any necessary preoperative steps.

drdeepeshkalra,"Passing a kidney stone can be a challenging experience, and understanding the timeframe and factors involved can help manage expectations and guide treatment decisions. In this article, we’ll explore how long it typically takes to pass a kidney stone, what factors influence this duration, and what you can do to ease the process.

# 1. Typical Timeframe for Passing a Kidney Stone

On average, most small [kidney stones](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YQ27xM9s6vpJK18N7) pass out of the body within **2 to 6 weeks** from the onset of symptoms. This duration can vary depending on several factors, including the size and location of the stone, as well as the individual’s overall health.

Here’s a breakdown of the typical timeframes:

* **Small Stones (Less than 5 mm)**: Stones of this size often pass on their own within **1 to 2 weeks**. Many patients experience relief within this relatively short period.
* **Medium Stones (5–10 mm)**: Stones of this size may take **2 to 4 weeks** to pass. Medical interventions might be considered if the stone does not pass within this timeframe.
* **Large Stones (Greater than 10 mm)**: Larger stones might take **several weeks to several months** to pass, and often require medical treatment to aid in their removal.

# 2. Factors Influencing the Passage of a Kidney Stone

Several factors can affect how long it takes to pass a kidney stone. Understanding these factors can provide insights into what might be affecting the duration of your experience:

* **Stone Size**: Generally, smaller stones pass more quickly than larger ones. Stones smaller than 4 mm have a high chance of passing spontaneously, while larger stones may require medical intervention.
* **Stone Location**: Stones located in the ureter (the tube connecting the kidney to the bladder) may take longer to pass than those in the kidney or bladder. If a stone is stuck in the ureter, it may cause more pain and take longer to pass.
* **Stone Composition**: The chemical makeup of the stone can impact how easily it breaks up and passes. For example, calcium oxalate stones might behave differently than uric acid stones.
* **Hydration Levels**: Adequate hydration can help flush out the stones. Drinking plenty of fluids increases urine flow, which can assist in moving the stone through the urinary tract.
* **Body Size and Health**: Individual health conditions and physical characteristics can also affect[ the passage of kidney stones](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YQ27xM9s6vpJK18N7). Generally, people with good hydration and those who are in good overall health may experience a quicker passage of stones.
* **Pain Management and Medication**: Medications for pain and to help pass the stone can influence how long it takes to pass. Alpha-blockers, for example, may help relax the ureter and speed up stone passage.

# 3. Symptoms and When to Seek Medical Attention

If you’re experiencing kidney stones, it’s important to be aware of the symptoms and when to seek medical help:

* **Mild to Moderate Symptoms**: Symptoms may include back pain, discomfort during urination, and hematuria (blood in urine). If symptoms are manageable and the stone is small, the process might be ongoing.
* **Severe Symptoms**: Intense pain, fever, chills, or difficulty urinating may indicate a complication, such as an infection or obstruction, and you should seek medical attention immediately.
* **Failure to Pass**: If a stone hasn’t passed within a few weeks, or if symptoms worsen, it’s important to consult a healthcare professional to explore other treatment options.

# 4. What You Can Do to Help Pass a Kidney Stone

Here are some practical steps you can take to facilitate the passage of a kidney stone:

* **Increase Fluid Intake**: Aim to drink 8–12 glasses of water a day. Staying hydrated helps dilute the urine and can make it easier for the stone to pass.
* **Pain Management**: Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help manage pain. For severe pain, prescription medications might be necessary.
* **Follow Medical Advice**: If prescribed medications like alpha-blockers or potassium citrate, be sure to take them as directed to help pass the stone.
* **Strain Your Urine**: Using a strainer when you urinate can help you catch the stone for analysis, which can guide future prevention strategies.
* **Adopt a Kidney Stone-Friendly Diet**: Depending on the type of stone, dietary adjustments might be recommended to prevent future stones. This could include reducing salt, oxalate, or purine intake.

# 5. Medical Interventions for Persistent Stones

For stones that do not pass on their own, several medical procedures can help:

* **Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL)**: This non-invasive procedure uses shock waves to break the stone into smaller pieces that can pass more easily.
* **Ureteroscopy**: A small scope is inserted into the urinary tract to remove or break up the stone.
* **Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL)**: A surgical procedure for larger stones, involving a small incision in the back to remove the stone.
* **Surgery**: In rare cases, open surgery might be required for very large or complex stones.

# Conclusion

The time it takes to pass a [kidney stone treatment](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YQ27xM9s6vpJK18N7) can vary widely depending on a range of factors, from the size and location of the stone to your overall health and hydration levels. While many stones pass on their own within a few weeks, larger stones or those causing complications may require medical intervention.

If you’re dealing with kidney stones, staying hydrated, managing pain, and following your doctor’s advice can all help in passing the stone more efficiently. For stones that don’t pass on their own, a variety of treatment options are available to help you achieve relief.

If you have concerns about your kidney stone or its treatment, be sure to consult with a healthcare provider to explore the best approach for your specific situation.

atgunpoint,"I’m 43f, now finally in the last few days of recovery from a long ordeal with kidney stone treatment. I wanted to share my experience in case it’s helpful to anyone. This will be long so thanks in advance for reading / letting me get this all out there. This has been traumatizing and it helps to send it out into the world.

In 2020 I passed my first kidney stone. I didn’t know what was happening or why I was in horrendous pain until it was out. Around this time I was also shedding a TON of hair and feeling generally unwell, so went to the doctor to see what was up.

Testing revealed hyperparathyroidism, which I suspect I had been suffering from for many years. I had a benign growth on one of my glands and it needed to come out. CT scans at the time also showed several stones in my left kidney that at the time were of an ok size to pass on their own, so they left them alone.

 I had the parathyroidectomy at the start of COVID, and all my blood levels returned to normal after, and remain that way thru to today. Of the stones from that scan only 2 passed over the next few years. Small enough that they did not hurt.

Since 2020 I continued to experience random episodes of what I thought were UTIs, and would occasionally have blood in my urine after a long run. I did not think much of this until last month when I straight up peed blood one night and freaked out.

A new CT scan showed 2 stones in my left kidney - same ones from 2020 - except much larger. Together they were 3cm of stone mass. I went in to have surgery in early June, and they removed them via an incision in my back (I forget the word for this procedure). They placed a stent and sent me home with follow up CT and stent removal appointments to come 2 weeks later.

The surgery went fine, but that stent was horrible. It was unbearable for a few days as my body outright tried to reject it. I got on a regimen of steroids and painkillers so I could manage until my follow ups. I was bedridden and out of it for 2 weeks waiting things out.

The second CT showed there was still a 5mm stone left behind following surgery, and it was directly on the stent so I had to have a second procedure to remove both. The scan also revealed that my body actually pushed the stent further down into my bladder.

For the second procedure they went up through my urethra instead of in through my back. When they removed the stent they discovered that my ureter had corkscrewed in its effort to reject it, which contributed to why I was in so so much pain. The doctors fixed all this and removed the remaining stone, leaving me with a stent with a string to remove on my own a few days later.

Second procedure was an easier and quicker recovery than the first but I was absolutely riddled with anxiety about removing the stent. Like, I cried ugly alligator tears about it for a full day ahead of pulling it out. I imagined all the ways in which it would go wrong or out me in the ER. It was Big. Drama.

But removing the stent was not the worst. It was less painful than digging out a splinter, a little more than pulling off a bandaid. Of course I took all the meds before so that probably helped. I was so deeply relieved down to my bones when it came out and I fortunately have not had any spasms or pain following. I am still on meds just in case, until tomorrow.

So I am on instructions to rest and take it easy for another couple days and then I can finally rejoin the land of the living and put this hopefully behind me. I cannot wait for this to be over.

Turtle_chips16,"April 1st I went to my pcp for what I thought was a UTI due to a sudden onset of dysuria. They prescribed antibiotics and I went on my way.

A week later, no improvement and the following weekend I went to the emergency room with severe kidney pain. They did some imaging, confirmed I had stones in both my left and right side then gave me pain meds and sent me home. 

A week after that, I returned to the hospital as the pain in my right side was unbearable. I was admitted and the next day did the lithotripsy and had a stent placed.

The stent was incredibly bothersome and uncomfortable during the 10 days I had it. I had severe dysuria despite taking pyridium around the clock and horrible cramping and throbbing.

I eventually got the stent removed, which I had read was a painless event but it turned out to be one of the most painful things I have encountered in a long time lol 

I continued to have mild pain on my left side and scheduled lithotripsy for mid May. This went well and I even passed some tiny stones at home for the first time. haven’t had pain/flare up in several weeks.

I still have some lingering stones but will just take it one day at a time.

Now realizing I didn’t have to summarize all of that to get to my point, but if you have made it this far then thank you.

I have noticed since this all unfolded that my blood sugars (I am a type 1 diabetic) have been near perfect. My average glucose reading is usually about 225 and my A1C has been above 9 for years now.

Now I sort of attribute this to being so uncomfortable I never wanted to eat thus nothing sky rocketing me past 150 but it just seems my diabetes is much easier to manage these days.

Alongside that, my tolerance to caffeine has flipped my world upside down.

Prior to the last couple of months I would get triple sometimes quad shots in my lattes, cold brew, frequent diet cokes, green teas, etc. and now even a half can of Diet Coke or a tall latte w one shot has me so jittery and anxious.

I have NEVER had this kind of response to caffeine in my entire life.

drdeepeshkalra,"Kidney stones are hard deposits of minerals and salts that form inside the kidneys. They can vary in size, from as small as a grain of sand to as large as a golf ball. While some kidney stones may pass through the urinary tract without causing any symptoms, larger stones can block the flow of urine, leading to intense pain and discomfort.

# Causes of Kidney Stones:

Understanding the underlying causes of kidney stones is crucial for prevention and treatment. Several factors contribute to their formation, including:

1. **Dehydration:** Not drinking enough water can lead to concentrated urine, increasing the risk of kidney stone formation.
2. **Diet:** Consuming foods high in oxalate, calcium, and salt can contribute to the development of kidney stones.
3. **Medical Conditions:** Certain medical conditions such as obesity, digestive diseases, and urinary tract infections can increase the likelihood of kidney stones.
4. **Genetics:** Family history plays a role in predisposing individuals to kidney stone formation.

drdeepeshkalra,"RIRS involves the use of a flexible ureteroscope, which is inserted through the urethra and bladder to access the kidney. The procedure allows the surgeon to directly visualize and treat stones within the kidney using laser lithotripsy, breaking them into smaller, more passable fragments. This minimally invasive approach eliminates the need for large incisions, reducing recovery time and discomfort for the patient.

# Key Benefits of RIRS Surgery

# 1. Minimally Invasive Nature

One of the most significant advantages of RIRS is its minimally invasive nature. Unlike traditional open surgery or even laparoscopic procedures, RIRS requires no external incisions. The entire process is performed through natural body openings, significantly reducing trauma to the body.

# 2. Reduced Recovery Time

Due to the lack of large incisions, patients who undergo RIRS experience much shorter recovery times. Most patients can return to their normal activities within a few days, making it a convenient option for those with busy lifestyles or those who cannot afford extended downtime.

# 3. Less Pain and Discomfort

RIRS is associated with less postoperative pain and discomfort compared to traditional kidney stone surgeries. The absence of large cuts minimizes pain and reduces the need for strong painkillers, which can have their own side effects.

# 4. Lower Risk of Complications

The minimally invasive nature of RIRS also contributes to a lower risk of complications such as infections, bleeding, and damage to surrounding organs. This makes it a safer option, especially for patients with comorbid conditions that might increase surgical risks.

# 5. High Success Rate

RIRS has a high success rate in effectively treating kidney stones. The use of advanced imaging and laser technology allows for precise targeting and removal of stones, ensuring that most patients achieve stone-free status after the procedure.

# 6. Ability to Treat Complex Cases

RIRS is highly effective for treating complex and difficult-to-reach stones. The flexible ureteroscope can navigate the intricate structures of the kidney, making it possible to treat stones in locations that would be challenging with other methods.

My cook has two kidney stones less than 6mm in size. She has been taking homeopathic medicines from 3-4 months but to no effect. 

So, I wanted to ask if she was to get herself checked in RML, in which department should I book the appointment? Nephrology? Urology? 

On selecting Nephrology, it says only referred cases will be accepted. 

Hospital customer care said book an appointment in medical department which I didn't understand. Did he mean medicine department?

drdeepeshkalra,"Kidney stones are a common yet painful condition that affects many people worldwide. Traditional treatments often involve invasive procedures and extended recovery times. However, advancements in medical technology have introduced laser kidney stone treatment as a minimally invasive and highly effective alternative.

# Understanding Kidney Stones

Kidney stones are hard deposits made of minerals and salts that form inside your kidneys. They can cause severe pain, urinary problems, and other complications if left untreated. Factors such as dehydration, diet, obesity, and certain medical conditions can contribute to the formation of kidney stones.

# The Basics of Laser Kidney Stone Treatment

[Laser kidney stone treatment](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YQ27xM9s6vpJK18N7), also known as laser lithotripsy, uses high-energy laser beams to break down kidney stones into smaller fragments. This procedure is typically performed using a thin, flexible tube called a ureteroscope, which is inserted through the urethra and bladder into the ureter and kidney.

https://preview.redd.it/ar6ahl1knb2d1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a9a0e85652e976b756c0fc4138bfad602ec6f04

# Step-by-Step Process of Laser Lithotripsy

**1.Preparation:** Before the procedure, patients are usually given anesthesia to ensure they are comfortable and pain-free. The type of anesthesia can vary based on the size and location of the stones.

**2. Insertion of the Ureteroscope:** Dr. Kalra gently inserts the ureteroscope through the urinary tract to reach the kidney stones. The ureteroscope is equipped with a camera, allowing the doctor to visualize the stones on a monitor.

**3. Laser Application:** Once the stones are located, a laser fiber is passed through the ureteroscope. The laser emits high-energy pulses that target and break the stones into tiny fragments. These fragments are small enough to be naturally passed out of the body through urine.

**4. Removal of Stone Fragments:** In some cases, Dr. Kalra may use special tools to remove larger fragments directly. This ensures that no residual pieces remain that could potentially cause future problems.

**5. Completion and Recovery:** After the stones are broken down and removed, the ureteroscope is carefully withdrawn. Patients are typically monitored for a short period before being allowed to go home. Recovery times are usually quick, with most patients resuming normal activities within a few days.

# Benefits of Laser Kidney Stone Treatment

* **Minimally Invasive:** Unlike traditional surgery, laser lithotripsy involves no large incisions, resulting in less pain and faster recovery.
* **High Success Rate:** This procedure effectively targets and breaks down stones of various sizes and compositions.
* **Quick Recovery:** Patients often experience minimal discomfort and can return to their daily routines swiftly.
* **Reduced Complications:** The precision of laser technology reduces the risk of damage to surrounding tissues.

# Post-Treatment Care

After the procedure, it’s important to follow Dr. Kalra’s recommendations for a smooth recovery. Drinking plenty of water helps flush out any remaining stone fragments. Additionally, maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle can prevent the formation of new stones.

# Conclusion
